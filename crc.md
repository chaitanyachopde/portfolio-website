## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static Website**: Pure frontend implementation with no backend dependencies
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: All content loads on a single HTML page with JavaScript-driven interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Bootstrap 5 grid system
- **Component-Based CSS**: Modular CSS architecture with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with interactive features

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Custom properties, flexbox, grid, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript with classes and modules
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework for responsive layout and components
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Google Fonts**: Custom typography (Poppins font family)

## Key Components

### 1. Theme System
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Persistent theme switching using localStorage
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Dynamic theming through CSS variables
- **Theme Manager Class**: JavaScript class handling theme state and persistence

### 2. Navigation System
- **Fixed Navigation**: Sticky navbar with scroll-spy functionality
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Animated transitions between sections
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Collapsible navigation for smaller screens

### 3. Animation Framework
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Scroll-triggered animations for content reveal
- **Typed.js**: Typewriter effect for dynamic text display
- **Custom CSS Animations**: Preloader, hover effects, and transitions

### 4. User Experience Features
- **Preloader**: Loading animation before content display
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: Floating action button with fade effects
- **Progress Bars**: Animated skill level indicators
- **Contact Form**: Client-side form with validation (no backend processing)

## Data Flow

### 1. Page Load Sequence
1. HTML structure loads
2. CSS files load and apply initial styling
3. JavaScript initializes after DOM content loaded
4. Theme preference retrieved from localStorage
5. Preloader displays while assets load
6. AOS animations initialize
7. Typed.js effects start after page is ready

### 2. Theme Management Flow
1. User clicks theme toggle button
2. ThemeManager class toggles theme state
3. CSS custom properties update via data attribute
4. New theme preference saved to localStorage
5. Toggle button icon updates to reflect current theme

### 3. User Interaction Flow
1. User scrolls through sections
2. Navigation updates active state (scroll-spy)
3. AOS triggers animations for elements entering viewport
4. Skill bars animate when About section is visible
5. Scroll-to-top button appears/disappears based on scroll position

## External Dependencies

### CDN Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: CSS framework and JavaScript components
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library
- **AOS 2.3.1**: Scroll animation library
- **Typed.js 2.0.12**: Typewriter effect library
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family

### Third-Party Services
- **Google Fonts API**: Font delivery
- **CDN Services**: jsDelivr and cdnjs for library delivery

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **Compatible Platforms**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting service
- **No Server Requirements**: Pure frontend implementation
- **CDN Optimization**: External libraries loaded from CDN for better performance

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: AOS animations only trigger when elements are in viewport
- **Local Storage**: Theme preferences cached locally to prevent flash of unstyled content
- **Minification Ready**: CSS and JavaScript structure supports minification for production

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Targets ES6+ compatible browsers
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device sizes and orientations

## Development Notes

### File Structure

- `css/style.css`: Custom styles and theme variables
- `js/script.js`: JavaScript functionality and interactions
- External dependencies loaded via CDN

### Code Organization
- **Modular JavaScript**: Features organized into classes and functions
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Centralized theming system
- **Semantic HTML**: Accessible and SEO-friendly markup structure

### Future Extensibility
